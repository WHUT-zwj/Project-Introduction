## Project Introduction


⚡ **( I ) Project 1:** Led a Provincial-level Undergraduate Entrepreneurial Practice Project — ```Wuxian Technology — Leader in Automotive 4D Imaging Millimeter-Wave Radar Antennas``` (March 2024 - Present).<br>
**Responsibilities:** As the primary project lead, I managed the team and coordinated the project's application, execution, and conclusion. I was also primarily responsible for developing the team's MIMO-based FMCW radar algorithms.<br>
**Achievements:** As the second person-in-charge, the project secured Silver Awards in both the Hubei Provincial China International College Students' 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and the Hubei Provincial iCAN Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition. Additionally, I engaged in technical exchanges with companies such as Desay SV (Nanjing).<br>

⚡ **( II ) Project 2:** ```Olympic Medal Prediction Based on Spatio-temporal Distribution and Zero-Truncation Characteristics``` (Project Lead) (January 2024).<br>
**Task:** To address the highly skewed distribution and zero-truncation issues in Olympic medal counts, while incorporating the coach effect, identifying both previously and first-time medaling countries, and quantifying uncertainty.<br>
**Solution:** We mined the spatio-temporal characteristics of medal trends, introduced the Tobit model to overcome zero-truncation limitations, quantified the coach effect using AHP-GRA, and employed Random Forest for medal prediction.<br>
**Personal Contributions:** Responsible for modeling and framework construction, writing sections on model and result analysis, visualization, spatio-temporal feature mining, and Tobit model programming and implementation.<br>
**Achievement:** Meritorious Winner (International First Prize equivalent) in the MCM/ICM International Collegiate Mathematical Contest in Modeling.<br>

⚡ **( III ) Project 3**: ```AI-Generated Face Image Recognition Based on Dual-Path Feature Extraction``` (Core Team Member) (September 2024 - December 2024).<br>
**Task:** To accurately identify and distinguish subtle feature differences between AI-generated and real face images under complex data distributions.<br>
**Solution:** Proposed an AI-generated face image recognition method based on DualFace-RCSD (Dual-ResNet Face Real-Synthetic Cascaded Detector). This approach utilizes parallel ResNet50 networks as the backbone to process images separately after MTCNN face detection and the original images. It then fuses the confidence scores and multi-dimensional features from the predictions of both ResNet50 networks, ultimately employing a decision tree for precise identification of AI-generated faces.<br>
**Achievement:** National Second Prize in the Global Campus AI Algorithm Elite Challenge.<br>

⚡ **( IV)  Project 4:** ```Joint Decision-Making for Crop Planting and Sales Based on a Multi-Objective Stochastic Programming Model``` (Project Lead) (September 2024).<br>
**Task:** To address the crop planting optimization problem in rural North China, with key challenges including the uncertainty of price fluctuations, complex inter-crop relationships, and balancing long-term risk management.<br>
**Solution:** Developed a multi-objective stochastic programming model, integrating Monte Carlo simulation with the NSGA-II algorithm to determine optimal planting strategies that balance profitability and risk.<br>
**Personal Contributions:** Responsible for modeling and framework construction, writing sections on model and result analysis, visualization, and programming the penalty function patching.<br>
**Achievement:** Hubei Provincial First Prize in the National College Student Mathematical Contest in Modeling.<br>

⚡ **( V ) Project 5:** ```Apple Recognition and Picking Point Localization Based on Residual Neural Network``` (Project Lead) (April 2024).<br>
**Task:** To address the challenges of apple recognition and localization for picking robots under conditions of occlusion, overlap, and light/shadow interference.<br>
**Solution:** Initially, apples were segmented using fuzzy clustering. Subsequently, an improved Canny edge detection algorithm was utilized for localization. Finally, the images were transformed into the HSV color space for classification using ResNet50.<br>
**Personal Contributions:** Responsible for modeling and framework construction, writing sections on model and result analysis, visualization, and programming the fuzzy clustering and ResNet50 implementation.<br>
**Achievement:** International First Prize (Outstanding Winner equivalent) in the Asia-Pacific Mathematical Contest in Modeling.<be>


⚡ **( VI ) Project 6:** ```Poverty Data Mining and Relative Poverty Identification under Big Data``` (Core Team Member).<br>
**Task:** To address the multi-dimensional complexity of relative poverty identification and establish a scientific identification system for precise classification.<br>
**Solution:** Constructed a multi-dimensional poverty-revitalization synergistic indicator system, performed feature selection based on Random Forest, and utilized a Bayesian cost-sensitive neural network for identification.<br>
**Personal Contributions:** Responsible for modeling and framework construction, writing sections on preprocessing, model, and result analysis, visualization, and programming the feature selection implementation.<br>
**Achievement:** First Prize in the Central South Regional Competition of the China Collegiate Computer Design Contest.<be>
